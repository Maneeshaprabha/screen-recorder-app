# Network Animation Project

A React project that creates a dynamic network animation with nodes and curved connections, inspired by a social network graph visualization. The project includes functionality to record the animation as a video.

## Features
- **Dynamic Animation**: Add nodes with a button click, with smooth animations for appearance using `react-spring`.
- **Curved Connections**: Connect nodes with curved lines using SVG `<path>` elements.
- **Recording**: Record the animation as a WebM video using the browser's MediaRecorder API via the `recordrtc` library.
- **Dark Theme**: Matches the aesthetic of a dark background with colorful nodes and lines.

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm installed.
- A modern browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) for recording functionality.
